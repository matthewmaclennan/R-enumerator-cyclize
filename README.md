# R-enumerator-cyclize
#Enumerate all (poly) cyclic molecules derivable from an acyclic originator
#This code will hijack SMILES strings by adding in numbers to create new cycles.
#Unique codes will be generated by InChI, but cyclization routes will be saved. This will contribute to the statistics of 
#cyclizations.
